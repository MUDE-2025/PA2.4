*Due: `Friday`, `December` `5th`, `2025`.*

You can preview this assignment on https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/workbook-2025/assignments/PA2.4/README.html. After the deadline, this link will include solutions. The preview of the assignment version is shared here: https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/workbook-2025/no_solutions/assignments/PA2.4/README.html. You can obtain your personal repository for submission on: https://classroom.github.com/a/FlYfcGpd.

In this assignment you'll make exercises on:

1. [Numpy `axis`](./1_axis.ipynb)
2. [Statsmodels autocorrelation function](./2_acf.ipynb)
3. [Assert statements](./3._asserts.ipynb)
4. [Tests](./4_tests.md)

You'll need to have done exercises 1 and 2 to be able to make the workshop and group assignment. Before doing exercise 3 and 4, please read the chapters in the [MUDE book](https://mude.citg.tudelft.nl/book/2025/programming/week_2_4.html).

You pass this PA if you:
- Obtained the correct values in task 1.2
- The notebook of exercise 2 runs without errors
- `my_test.py` runs with `pytest` without any errors and all tests pass

`3_assert.py` will not be checked by the autograder, but you can see the error messages yourself easily enough :)
