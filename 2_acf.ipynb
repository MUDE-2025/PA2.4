    "## Part 2: Correlated Behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have three years of data, we want to see if there is a trend in our behavior. We can take the correlation concepts we learned in Q1 and see if there is a relationship from one month to the next. In other words: if we spend a lot of coins one month, is the _probability_ that we spend a lot of coins the next month _higher_? Evaluating correlation this way has many names: autocorrelation, autocovariance, etc...the \"auto\" in this case refers to evaluating the relationship between data from the same sequence (you will learn about it more in the time series reading). Luckily, there is a built-in method of `statsmodels` that does this for us automatically: the correlation is plotted on the y-axis, as a function of the 'distance' between two points in the series. It is important to recognize that the correlations represent any point in the series (analogous to an average), rather than any specific point)\n",
