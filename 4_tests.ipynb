    "In the previous notebook you became familiar with the assert statement. \n",
    "Assert statements are a way of quickly checking if a certain snippet of code returns the expected output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you want to be able to quickly run a script to check if your code is working correctly. In such cases you will want to create some kind of test file. You have probably noticed that the PAs often have a `.py` file with some tests in it. We will flip the switch in this notebook. We have provided you with a corrected and updated version of the function `max_even_square` from last week. Now write a test for it!\n",
